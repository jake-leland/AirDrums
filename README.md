AirDrums
========

(Kinect) A Virtual Drumset.

Note: This is a [Processing](http://processing.org/) sketch.

This was an Xbox Kinect project, so the code will only work with a Kinect.
If you have a Kinect, I'm using the [Simple-OpenNI libraries](http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/).

This program projects the shape of the user in virtual space as if the camera was behind the user, and draws a virtual drumset in front of him or her.
The user can play the drums by reaching out and "touching" one of the drums on screen. (Mouse movement can be used to rotate the camera to other angles).
