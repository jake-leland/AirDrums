(Kinect) A Virtual Drumset

This was an Xbox Kinect project; the code will only work with a kinect.
If you have a Kinect, I'm using the [Simple-OpenNI libraries](http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/).

This program projects the image of the user (it appears as if the camera is behind the user), and draws a virtual drumset in front of him/her.
The user can play the drums by reaching out and "touching" one of the drums on screen. (Mouse movement can be used to rotate the camera to other angles).
